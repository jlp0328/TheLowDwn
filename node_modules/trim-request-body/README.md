# Trim Request Body

Trim request body parsed with body-parser.

## Installation

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install trim-request-body --save
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add trim-request-body
```

## Usage

In [ExpressJs](http://expressjs.com/):

```js
// The Express app.
const app = express()

// `body-parser` middleware should be loaded before `trim-request-body`
app.use(require('body-parser').urlencoded({ extended: false }))

// Trim the parsed request body.
app.use(require('trim-request-body')())
```

## Example

`req.body` before the trim:

```json
{
  "foo": "  bar ",
  "foobar": "foobar@example.com       ",
  "baz": [
    "  baz   "
  ],
  "foobarbaz": 100
}
```

`req.body` after the trim:

```json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "foobar": "foobar@example.com",
  "baz": [
    "baz"
  ],
  "foobarbaz": 100
}
```
